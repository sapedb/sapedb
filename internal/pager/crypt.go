// Encryption at rest, one key per database.
//
// What is encrypted is the payload of every page that holds data: the leaves,
// the branches, the chains of large values, the free list. What is not is the
// meta page, and that is a deliberate, stated trade rather than an oversight.
//
// Something has to be readable without the key, or "this is not our file" and
// "this is our file and your key is wrong" become the same answer, and anybody
// holding a database they cannot open has no way to tell which mistake they
// made. So the meta page keeps its magic, its format, the salt the key was
// derived with, and a value that can only be opened by the right key. Opening
// a database therefore says immediately whether the key is right, before a
// single document is touched.
//
// The cost of that is what the meta page leaks: how many pages the file has,
// how many transactions it has seen, and where its root is. Not documents, not
// keys, not the names of anything — but it is a real leak and it is written
// down here rather than discovered later.
//
// Each page carries its own nonce, drawn fresh on every write. The alternative
// — deriving a nonce from the page number and the transaction — looks tidier
// and is wrong here: this engine writes the same page more than once inside a
// transaction, and a repeated nonce under one key is the failure that takes
// AES-GCM apart completely.
//
// The page number and kind go in as additional data rather than as plaintext
// to be trusted. A whole page moved to another position is then refused by the
// cipher itself, not merely by a checksum somebody could recompute.

// Both used to carry the product's old name, kept on the argument that
// changing either one is a silent, unannounced key rotation: the key derived
// for an existing file stops matching the key derived from the same secret,
// which reads as "wrong key" for a key that is right, and fails at ErrKey
// rather than anywhere that names a format. That argument was true and is
// now spent — the repository carries no tags at all, so there has never been
// a release, and no encrypted database written by a build anybody else ran
// exists to be locked out. This commit is the rename; from 1.0.0 on these
// only ever move together with a migration that re-derives and re-encrypts
// every affected page.
//
// The :v1 suffixes stay :v1 on purpose. This is not a new version of the
// derivation scheme — the algorithm, the salt and the key length are
// untouched — it is the same scheme with the product's current name in it.
