// Package pager is the file format: pages, their checksums, and the one write

//
// The shape is copy-on-write. A transaction writes new pages, never the pages
// it read; when it is done it makes them durable and then writes one meta
// page. That meta page is smaller than a sector, so a disk either has the new
// one or it does not — there is no half-written commit, and therefore no
// recovery pass at startup. Recovery code only runs after a crash, which is
// exactly when nobody is watching; the cheapest way to have it be right is not
// to have it.
//
// Two meta pages alternate. Opening a file reads both and takes the newer one
// that checksums; a crash mid-commit leaves the older one, which is the state
// the last completed transaction left behind.
