// This file lives in package server_test rather than package server because
// it is the one place in the suite that imports both internal/cli and
// internal/server, and verifies the thing neither package's own test file
// can: that a database internal/cli writes is one internal/server can
// actually open. cli_test.go runs the CLI on the CLI's own files;
// server_test.go runs the server on the server's own files. Each side has
// only ever agreed with itself — the exact shape that let two copies of a
// key-derivation label drift silently apart (see internal/dbkey), and the
// exact shape house-rules.md's "Run For Real" section names as having let three
// real contract mismatches through unit tests before.
//
// It is also the only thing in the suite that catches that mine being laid
// again, and internal/naming's patrol is not a substitute for it. A second
// copy of the label that keeps the old product name and merely bumps the
// suffix to v2 turns itself in, because the old name is what the patrol
// watches for. The honest shape of the mistake does not: a well-meaning
// cleanup writes the label out under the current product name, still at v1,
// the patrol goes green because there is no old name left for it to hit, and
// the only thing that notices is a database one side wrote and the other
// cannot open. Measured: that honest second copy, plus deleting this file,
// leaves all 14 packages green. So do not delete it, do not t.Skip it, and
// do not argue that the patrol still covers this — against the shape a real
// person would actually type, it does not.
