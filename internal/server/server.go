// on first use without any provisioning step: a name nobody has blessed cannot
// be reached, and a name that has been blessed needs no further record.

// Everything after the handshake is a declared operation invoked by name. The
// server does not parse a query language because there is not one; it looks up
// the operation the database already holds, and runs it.

// than today's crash, not just no better: runBatch (batch.go) calls
// s.Rollback() only on its error path, not with its own defer, so a panic
// partway through it skips that call and leaves s.pages.Pending() true —
// and runBatch's own first line refuses to run anything else on a database
// with Pending() true, forever, for every caller, until the process
// restarts. A server that survives a panic by recovering and serving on
// would answer every write after that on this database with ErrUncommitted
// for as long as it stayed up: a wrong answer that outlives the panic that
// caused it. Dying is the safe path already available — storage here
// tolerates power loss (two meta pages, an ordered write sequence) and
// sayHowItWasLeft reports exactly that shape of shutdown the next time the
// file opens — so this does not try to invent a safer one.
//
// It is also not an answer to task 0049's other half: satisfies (batch.go)
// used to be able to end a goroutine with `fatal error: stack overflow`,
// not a panic, over a self-referential argument through the exported
// Invoke. No recover() anywhere — this one included — catches a fatal
// error; that half is closed by describe (describe.go) making the format
// call return instead of recursing forever, not by anything here. A guard
// at this boundary and a bounded formatter one layer down are two
// different fixes for two different ways a goroutine could stop, and one
// does not stand in for the other.
//
// And it only covers the ONE goroutine it is deferred in — Serve's
// per-connection goroutine, above. recover() only ever catches a panic
// unwinding through its own goroutine's own defer stack; it cannot reach
// into another one. This is not this connection's only goroutine: follow
// (subscribe.go) starts a second one per live subscription with
// `go s.stream(...)`, and stream has no recover of its own. A panic inside
// stream today crashes the whole process exactly as if this file did not
// exist — measured in TestGuardInOneGoroutineDoesNotProtectAPanicInAnother
// Goroutine (server_test.go), which is the general case (any two
// goroutines, not stream specifically) because reaching an actual panic
// inside stream would need a separate task's worth of fault injection.
// Giving stream its own guard is future work this task does not do: section 5
// keeps this task's touch to guard and Serve.
//
// What it actually buys, measured against having nothing here at all: a
// client gets a Failure frame instead of a socket that just closes (0048
// taught the client driver to read ID 0 as a reason at teardown; before
// that, this would have been silent to the client too), and the operator
// gets a line naming the remote address, the panic value, and a stack —
// where before this there was nothing at all, on any of the panics
// task 0042 already knew this goroutine could throw.
//
// What is NOT reused after this runs: nothing. The three steps below run
// against the state as it stood at the moment of the panic — a
// best-effort write on a connection that may itself be half torn, a log
// line, nothing more — and then the same panic value goes back out

// property of which fields today's errors reach for — not a rule the
// structure enforces — so anyone adding a field to hello (a token, a
// session key) has to check it again rather than assume this axis is
// closed for free. Quoting is %q throughout, so a newline in a caller's
// value cannot forge a second line in the log.
//
// No throttle: a caller that keeps knocking with the same bad credentials
// produces one line per attempt. A handshake that fails has already spent an
