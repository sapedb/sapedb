// This file lives in package server_test, alongside handoff_test.go, for
// the same reason that one gives for its own placement: it is where a test
// can import both internal/dbname and internal/server and check that they
// actually agree, rather than trusting "they call the same function" as an
// argument on its own. Task 0053's section 2 says a shared function only one
// caller actually reaches is not a shared rule — this is what proves
// internal/server's caller is one of the ones actually reaching it.

// TestDbnameAndServerStoreAgreeOnEveryName runs one list of names through
// two doors — dbname.Check directly, and server.Store, which task 0053
// made call dbname.Check at internal/server/server.go's database() — and
// requires the same verdict from both for every name, in both the account
// position and the database position.
//
// The list mixes three kinds of case on purpose: two the path-separator
// clause alone would refuse (a/b, and NUL), several that clause does NOT
// refuse but the character table does (a;b, m|n, "a b" — task 0053 section 3's
// "not every half of the rule is a separator" finding), and two controls at
// the 64-character boundary that must be accepted by both doors. A table
// that only exercised the separator clause would not catch server.database
// or dbname.Check narrowing to just that clause.
