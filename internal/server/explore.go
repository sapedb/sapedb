// Operating a database over the wire.
//
// The shell needs something no ordinary connection may do: run an access
// nobody declared. A connection string cannot say so — it signs what to reach,
// not what you may do once there — and a client that claims it about itself
// has claimed nothing.
//
// So the server challenges, and an operator answers with proof that it holds
// the server's own secret. Whoever holds that can already read the files and
// mint any connection string they like, so this hands out no power that was
// not already there. What it adds is that everything done this way is in the
// change log with a name against it, which reading the files is not.

// ErrNotOperator is an explore or a declare on a connection that has not
// proved itself. One sentinel for both, so codeFor keeps answering
// "not_operator" whichever frame was refused — a client switches on the code,
// and two codes for one reason would be two things to handle.
