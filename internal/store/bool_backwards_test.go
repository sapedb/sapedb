// TestABackwardsBoolRangeIsAcceptedRatherThanRefused pins a real, measured
// gap in task 0045's promise, found while building task 0054's case table
// (section 3.4 of the task doc) rather than something this task fixes.
//
// Task 0045 made stretch() (scan.go) refuse a From that sorts after To,
// rather than silently reading as an empty stretch. The refusal is keyed on
// lower == upper being LEFT ALONE (not refused) because that shape usually
// means "an Exclusive bound pinned against itself" or, on a number field,
// two inclusive ends one ULP apart — both genuinely empty ranges a caller
// meant to write.
//
// A bool field breaks that assumption completely rather than at one edge:
// it has exactly two values, so keys.Encode(false) and keys.Encode(true)
// are one step apart, and EVERY backwards pair on a bool field — not some
// of them — lands on lower == upper. Task 0045's promise therefore covers
// none of the domain on a bool field: this test's own name says what is
// actually true today, not "every backwards range is refused" (which is
// false and must not be written anywhere as though it were).
//
// This is deliberately not fixed here — see the comment 0054 added to
// stretch()'s doc (scan.go) for the measurements and for why a fix needs its
// own widen-the-net measurement this task has no budget for. The gap is not
// a data-loss bug: the wrong answer is an empty one, not a wrong one, which
// is exactly what makes it safe to leave pinned rather than guessed at.
