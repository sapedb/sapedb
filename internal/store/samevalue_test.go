// universal claim have to be before it stops being a sample". QA measured
// this directly rather than picking a round number: with the array test's
// length loop capped at 8, the map test's key-count loop capped at 6, and
// the depth test's nest loop capped at 6, five typo-shaped mutants survived
// — a mutant is not obligated to be caught the moment it exists, but a
// wall that sits exactly on a table's own boundary (compare only the first
// N elements/keys, skip exactly index N, treat anything past depth N as
// equal) means the boundary was doing the mutant's job for it. Widening to
// these three numbers killed every one of them, and nobody has since found
// a typo-shaped bug that only shows up past them. That is still a bounded
// claim, not a proof for every possible length — say so here instead of
// letting a test named "every element" or "every depth" imply otherwise,
// and if a future mutant survives specifically past one of these numbers,
// the fix is to raise the constant again and record why, not to patch in

// rather than taking the name's word for it:
//
//   - Round one's name ("...OnBothSidesOfTheWire") called json.Unmarshal
//     directly and never went through ops.go or server.go at all, so "the
//     wire" was read off the standard library's documented behavior, not
//     measured through this store's own code that does the decoding. It
//     also missed that sameValue is never called with (declaration,
//     argument) at all — satisfies (batch.go) calls it with (a document
//     field, wanted), and wanted is resolveIn's result, which may itself
//     have come from a declaration, an argument, or an earlier step.
//   - Round two added the document path for real (Collection.Put/Get, this
//     package's own Marshal/Unmarshal round trip) but left the declaration
//     path as the same kind of bare json.Unmarshal probe round one used —
//     a payload shaped like a declaration, decoded by this test's own call
//     to encoding/json, not by ops.go's. A change to ops.go's own decoder
//     (dec.UseNumber(), say) would leave that subtest green.
//
// This round fixes the declaration path the way round two fixed the
// document path: through the real call. "Depth" is dropped from the name
// because every subtest here already checks several depths inline, not
// because depth stopped mattering — the words that were actually wrong were
