// TestEveryIndexedFieldListReadIsOnTheList is the structural half of task
// 0054 — the case table above (lockstep_test.go) only proves the lockstep
// property holds at the sites that exist TODAY. It says nothing about a
// NINETEENTH place that starts indexing into Fields/Terms/Group next
// month (the list below has exactly 18 entries — Reviewer 0054 measured
// that an earlier draft of this comment said "twelfth"/"thirteenth" here,
// which was simply wrong arithmetic against the list's own length, not a
// claim about the code; SAPE-8 added the eighteenth, store.envelopeOf,
// which SAPE-12 renamed to store.EnvelopeOf and store.ceiling to
// store.ceilingOf — a rename, not a nineteenth entry).
//
// This greps every non-test .go source file in internal/store and
// internal/keys for an expression that reads a named element out of one of
// the lists this task is about (Fields, Terms, Group, fields, Include, Sum,
// Steps, Indexes, Rollups) by a loop-shaped index name (i, at, spread, idx),
// records which function each match falls inside, and requires that set of
// functions to equal EXACTLY the list below — no fewer, no more. A
// EIGHTEENTH reader appearing without a matching line added here fails
// this test; a reader disappearing (say, because a function was deleted)
// also fails it, so the list cannot go stale in either direction without
// someone noticing.
//
// The "which function" tracking is deliberately the simplest thing that
// works: scan the file top to bottom, and every line beginning with "func "
// updates "the current function". A match on a line that is still part of
// the PREVIOUS function's doc comment — because the doc comment sits above
// the func line it documents — is attributed to that previous function, not
// the one it is actually documenting. This is not a bug in the test: it is
// why store.bound is on the list below even though bound() itself does not
// index anything. Its doc comment ends right where boundAt's begins
// (scan.go), and boundAt's own doc comment says "fields[i].Path" while
// explaining why the loop names the field a failure happened at — a comment
// line, not code, and the naive scan attributes it to whichever func line
// came before it lexically, which is bound's. Measured, not asserted: an
// earlier draft of this list, built by reasoning about the code rather than
// running this exact scan, had fifteen entries and was missing this one.
//
// What this test does NOT catch, on purpose, said in words because a green
// test here buys more confidence than it should: endpointBound (ops.go)
// walks its terms with "for _, term := range endpoint.Terms" — a range over
// values, not an index — so a rewrite of it that silently stops after the
// first term (the exact shape of mutant M3 in the task doc, which the
// case table in lockstep_test.go catches and this structural test does not)
// matches none of these patterns and is invisible here. Only the case table
// catches that shape; this test only catches a NEW index-shaped reader
// showing up unnoticed.
