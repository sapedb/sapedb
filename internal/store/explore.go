// Exploring is looking inside a database without declaring an operation first.
//
// Every database needs it. Something is wrong at two in the morning, and the
// operation that would answer the question was never written because nobody
// knew the question would be asked. A store that cannot be looked into is one
// people copy out to somewhere that can, which is worse in every way.
//
// What it is not is a query language. The way this is usually solved — mongo
// runs JavaScript inside the server, and every production deployment turns it
// off — makes the shell a second, more powerful interface than the one the
// application uses, available to whoever reaches the port. Here an access
// somebody types has exactly the shapes an operation may declare: a document
// by its key, a stretch of a declared index, a count of one. The only
// difference is when the parameters arrive.
//
// That is not a restriction bolted on afterwards. Explore builds the Operation
// the typed access would have to be declared as, runs it through
// validateOperation, and runs it down the same path. An access that could not
// be declared cannot be typed, because there is nowhere for it to go. And the
// declaration it built is handed back, so exploring ends in something to
// commit rather than in a habit of poking at production.
//
// One rule is not the same here, and saying so is the point of this paragraph:
// the limit. asOperation caps Limit at MostRows when it is missing or too
// large, BEFORE validateOperation runs, so neither "a scan must declare how
// many rows it may return" nor "a count must declare how far it walks" can
// ever fire through Explore — no matter what an operator types. That is
// deliberate for a shell (see asOperation's own comment: an operator who does
// not say is not asking for everything) and wrong for a declaration, which is
// a promise about cost somebody else has to keep. This paragraph used to read
// "checks it with the same validation a declaration gets", full stop, and that
// sentence was wrong for exactly this rule for as long as it stood. The
// asymmetry is measured, side by side, in internal/server's
// TestAScanDeclaredOverTheWireMustSayHowManyRowsItMayReturn and
// TestACountDeclaredOverTheWireMustSayHowFarItWalks — one per action, both
// against the Declare frame, which does NOT cap and must not.
//
// Two things follow from it being the same engine:
//
//   - A scan has a limit, always. Exploring is where an unbounded scan would
//     be reached for, and this store has none to reach for.
//   - Every access is written to the change log with who ran it. It costs a
//     commit for a read, which is the price of nobody being able to look
//     through a production database quietly. Replicas replay the entry as
//     nothing, because nothing changed.

// MostRows is the most an exploratory scan may return.
//
// A number, not "unlimited", for the same reason a declared scan has a limit:
// the operator at two in the morning is exactly the person who will scan a
// collection of forty million documents to see what is in it, and find out
// how big it was by waiting.
const MostRows = 1000

// Access is one thing an operator asks to look at.
//
// It is the parameters of an operation, arriving now instead of having been
// declared. Which is why there is no field here for anything an operation
// cannot declare.
