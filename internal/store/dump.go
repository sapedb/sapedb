// A dump is the database written out as itself: declarations, operations and
// documents, one JSON object to a line.
//
// It is taken from a snapshot, so nothing is locked and the writer carries on
// while it is written. Copy-on-write already keeps the pages of a committed
// state intact for as long as somebody is holding it, which is exactly what a
// consistent backup needs and is the reason a snapshot costs nothing to take.
//
// The line that matters most is the last one. A dump that was cut short — the
// disk filled, the pipe broke, the process was killed — looks exactly like a
// dump of a smaller database, and restoring one of those loses data in a way
// that nothing afterwards can detect. So a dump ends with a count and the
// number of the change it was taken at, and a restore that does not reach that
// line refuses the whole file.
//
// That number is also what makes a restore useful rather than merely a copy: a
// replica restored from a dump knows exactly where to pick the log up, so the
// two together cover a replica that has fallen further behind than the log
// keeps.

// Restore reads a dump into a database with nothing in it, and returns the
// change it was taken at.
//
// It must be empty: restoring over a database that already holds something
// would leave a mixture of two, which is neither of them and looks like a
// working database.
//
// # Why this is the one path ISS-35 does not check
//
// Every other door a declaration or a constant comes through refuses a number
// float64 cannot hold as written — `sapedb apply`, `sapedb install`, the
// Declare, Establish, Explore and Invoke frames. This one does not, and the
// reason is that a dump is not somebody's declaration. It is this database's
// own printout, and the numbers in it are already spelled the way a float64
// prints rather than the way anybody typed them.
//
// That spelling is not always a number float64 holds. A constant declared as
// 9223372036854775808 is accepted — 2^63 is exactly a float64, nothing is lost
// — and Write prints it as 9223372036854776000, because that is the shortest
// decimal identifying that float64. Read back as a literal, 9223372036854776000
// is a plain integer whose nearest float64 is 2^63, so the rule would refuse
// it: a checked Restore would refuse this database's own dump, and the refusal
// would say the value "would be stored as 9223372036854776000 instead", which
// is the number it was given.
//
// Losing dump-and-restore, above 2^53, is a worse outcome than a hand-edited
// dump carrying a number nobody can store — and a hand-edited dump is already
// outside what this function can check, since it reinstalls specs and puts
// documents without re-deriving anything. So this path takes its numbers on
// trust, deliberately, and internal/cli's TestADumpStillRestores is what keeps
// somebody from closing the gap and breaking the thing it protects.
