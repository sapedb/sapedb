// These tests measure the self-referential-value trade the godoc on
// sameValue (batch.go) now documents, instead of leaving it as prose for
// the next reader to take on faith. Task 0042's QA rounds caught two things
// wrong with the version of that story the code carried before this file
// existed: the "who can reach it" sentence was both too wide (it named the
// operator shell and JSON clients, which cannot build a cycle at all) and
// too narrow in a way that mattered more (it missed that a direct Go caller
// of the exported Invoke can crash the process without sameValue's own
// recursion ever running long). Both directions of that mistake are
// measured below rather than argued about.

// buildCycle is a []any holding itself at index 0 — the simplest value that
// (directly or through something it contains) contains itself.

// value reaching sameValue recurses forever. Measured instead: it does not,
// as long as the OTHER operand is an ordinary finite value. sameValue's
// type switch always descends into whichever operand it is looking at, so
// the walk bottoms out the moment that operand's real, finite structure
// runs out — a length mismatch or a failed type assertion ends the call the
// same way it would end an ordinary comparison, regardless of what the
// other side is still willing to do. This is what makes the paragraph in
// batch.go's godoc about the document side being safe actually hold: a
// document field (always finite, see TestPutRefusesToStoreASelfReferential

// `fatal error: stack overflow` inside satisfies' own %v formatting. That
// was 0042's measured, correct account of the code as it stood then. It is
// not the account of the code as it stands now: satisfies (batch.go) formats
// "wanted" and a mismatched "value" through describe (describe.go) instead
// of a bare %v, and describe is built to return a bounded string instead of
// recursing forever on exactly this shape. Leaving the old version of this
// test in place, unchanged, would have meant a green suite quietly stopped
// measuring the one thing this file exists to measure — the house rule
// about a mutation harness needing its assertions kept honest applies just
// as much to a fix that lands for real as it does to a mutation that only
// pretends to.

// test exists to kill three different ways at the exact call sites in
// batch.go), the failure mode is the fatal stack overflow this test used to
// expect — and a fatal error inline would take the whole `go test` binary
// down with it, package-wide, rather than reporting one red test. Isolating
