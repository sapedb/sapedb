// This file exists to break one sentence: "a direction widens nothing" — the
// set of rows a declaration can hand back is the same whichever direction the
// caller picks.
//
// Rounds one through three tried to keep that sentence true while From and To
// swapped which one was the walk's upper end depending on Direction, and
// refused whichever shape of declaration that swap made unsafe: a constant at
// one end (round one), the two ends disagreeing about Exclusive (round two),
// the two ends written at different widths (round three, caught by the
// Reviewer, not by this file — reachShapes writes one term per end and never
// exercised width). Round four removed the swap instead of refusing a fourth
// shape.
//
// So this file no longer has an accepted/refused axis. Every shape below
// declares without error now, because there is no rule left in checkDirection
// to refuse any of them for. What is left to check is sharper than "declared
// or not": for every pair of argument values, the forward call and the
// reverse call of the SAME declaration must (a) both match an oracle computed
// straight off the fixture rows, by ordinary Go comparisons rather than
// through bound() or walk(), and (b) be exactly each other's rows backwards —
// not merely the same set, the same order reversed, which is the one thing
// Direction is allowed to change.
//
// The list of shapes stayed, even with the rule gone that used to refuse some
// of them: they are still a useful cross-section of ways a bound gets
// written, and TestTheTwoBoundsNeverDependOnDirection (direction_v4_test.go)
// reuses this exact list for a second, independent check at the byte level.
//
// This round found the enumeration itself had a hole: the DOMAIN a caller's
// argument may range over had "" in it, but no actual ROW ever carried "".
// Crossing an argument domain against itself only ever sees what a caller
// could pass; it says nothing about what is stored, and round three's leak
// was about a row sitting at the floor of the index's own byte encoding, not
// about "" as a value somebody happened to type. So the fixture carries a row
// at that floor (fillWithFloor, below) and the assertions compare against it
// directly, not through the domain. QA's mutate27.py measured this by
// removing "" from the domain and watching the harness report MORE leaking
// shapes, not fewer, back when there was still something to leak — "" in the
// domain, with no row there to find, was quietly absorbing calls that would
// otherwise land past every row and come back empty either way, which reads
// as "the two directions agree" even though neither direction reached
// anything.
//
// Two things this file measures and does NOT decide are written down here
// once rather than at every place they would otherwise look unexamined:
//
//   - Optional arguments with no default are the one shape checkDirection
//     still refuses outright (see TestADirectionThatCannotBeWorkedOutIs...
//     in direction_test.go) — a bound whose argument is optional can fall
//     away entirely at call time, which is task 0016's hole, not this file's.
//     QA checked by hand that it does not leak on reachability even so (both
//     directions' unions equal the whole index), and nothing in this round
//     changes that.
//   - Limit is not part of what this file measures. declareReach writes
//     Limit: 50 because a scan must declare one to be valid at all, and
//     TestALimitStopsAScanFromEitherEnd (direction_test.go) already measures
//     that it cuts both directions the same way. TestALimitCanHandBack...
//     (direction_v4_test.go) measures the one thing Limit is allowed to do
//     that a bound is not: hand back different rows from either end of the
//     SAME stretch. Neither is a bound this file's oracle applies.
//
// Composite bounds (more than one term at an end) and a Term{Step: ...} at a
// bound are outside reachShapes on purpose: it writes exactly one term per
// end, and its oracle only knows how to check a bound that shape against real
// rows. The composite column is measured instead by
// TestTheTwoBoundsNeverDependOnDirection and TestByAuthorFloorRowReadsOne...
// (direction_v4_test.go), and a Step term at a scan bound is refused by
// check() before it is ever compared to anything (QA measured this in round
// three). Widening reachShapes to write several terms per end is a task of
// its own if anyone needs it measured this way instead.

// reachEnd is one end of a stretch as a declaration may write it: a constant
// nobody can move, an argument the caller fills in, or nothing at all.

//     the two bullets above do not, on their own, pin down (they would both
//     hold if a mutation reordered rows within a call without touching which
//     rows there were).
//
// It replaces round three's reaches(), which unioned every call's rows
// across the whole domain before comparing directions — a union that
// absorbed a single call's off-by-one into rows some other call already
// contributed. See TestAnExclusiveEndIsOutsideTheStretchWhicheverWayTheWalk
// Enters in direction_qa2_test.go for the mutation that survived exactly that
// hole; checking every call on its own, forward and reverse both, is why this
// version does not need that test's help to catch it.
//
// Task 0045 added a third outcome: crossing the domain against itself, as
// "both ends arguments" and its neighbours do, writes plenty of pairs where
// low sorts after high — a nonsensical range now refused with ErrArgument
// rather than read as empty. This function does not try to predict, for an
// arbitrary shape, exactly which pairs that is: doing that from outside would
// mean recomputing boundAt's Exclusive/successor arithmetic a second time in
// the test, which is the very duplication task 0045 section 1 exists to close —
// a second copy here would drift from the real rule exactly the way a third
// copy in production would have. What this function asks instead is the
// symmetry every other test in this round also leans on: whichever outcome a
// pair gets, forward and reverse must get the SAME one. A mutation that made
// stretch() direction-dependent about refusing (accepting forward, refusing
// reverse, or the reverse) would fail here even though nothing here knows in
// advance which pairs ought to be refused. Whether the refused-or-not split
// is the RIGHT split, for the shapes it can happen to at all, is measured
// directly and independently in direction_0045_test.go — this file's oracle
// only ever knew how to check accepted rows against real ones, not whether
// accepting was the right call, and that was already true before this round.
