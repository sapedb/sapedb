// Task 0054 exists because three places in internal/store read the i-th
// element of one list while walking another — scanAcross's and
// totalsAcross's Terms[i], and endpointBound's implicit "every term" loop —
// and every existing index or rollup group in this repo has exactly one
// field. At N=1, "the i-th element" and "the first element" are the same
// expression, so a suite built entirely on N=1 fixtures cannot tell a
// lockstep bug from a correct one: it is not that the tests are shallow, it
// is that the property under test ("every field is read at its own
// position, in order") has no N>1 case to be false on.
//
// lockstepStore is the one fixture every test in this file shares, built
// wide enough that the eleven mutations Planner 0054 found surviving (see
// the task doc, section 1.1) each have a case that can only pass by reading the
// right field at the right position. Every test below either tries to make
// a "must be refused" claim false (a case the refusal does not catch), or
// tries to make an "must be accepted" claim false (a case an over-tight
// check refuses) — house rule: a universal claim needs a table trying to
// break it, not a single sample that happens to hold.

// lockstepStore declares two collections sharing the same field shapes.
//
// Two collections, not one, is a fact of the code rather than a taste of the
// fixture: scanAcross (ops.go) refuses a scan of a PARTITIONED collection
// that leaves any field of its index ranging, before refusedBackwardsRange
// ever gets a chance to judge the values. So "every field must be pinned"
// (scanAcross's rule) and "a backwards range must be refused" (0045's rule)
// need different collections to exercise — a partitioned one for the first,
// an unpartitioned one for the second, or the first rule refuses the
// declaration before the second is ever reached. Measured directly: Planner
// hit this once (a probe named for the wrong function) before splitting the
// fixture in two.

// TestARollupGroupWithTwoDifferentDirectionsTotalsEachCombinationSeparately

// where the two fields do NOT share a direction — the shape that, before
// this task, existed nowhere in the repo (task doc section 1.2: "a rollup
// group with more than one field: DOES NOT EXIST, anywhere"). Every write to a group
// goes through groupKey (rollup.go), which calls keys.EncodeKey once for
// the whole Group; every read decodes the same bytes with keys.DecodeKey.
// A version of either that used fields[0]'s encoding for every position
// would, for account (ascending) and kind (DESCENDING), write kind's tag
// byte uncomplemented and then try to read it back as though it were
// complemented — which keys.Decode does not silently misread as a
// different value, it refuses with ErrTag, because the byte no longer
// matches any known tag. So this is not a silent-corruption case; a
// lockstep bug here surfaces as Totals returning an error where the
// unmutated code returns four distinct, correctly-labeled rows.
