// This file is round four's front door. Three rounds refused a growing list
// of shapes because From and To swapped which one was the upper end of the
// stretch depending on Direction — a constant at one end, the two ends
// disagreeing about Exclusive, the two ends written at different widths, and
// (found while writing this round) a pinned constant plus a small Limit.
// Round four removed the swap instead of refusing a fourth shape: From is the
// low end and To is the high end, in both directions, and stretch() proves it
// with byte comparisons rather than with a fixture and a domain of argument
// values. See scan.go's Range doc and ops.go's checkDirection for what that
// leaves behind.

// TestTheTwoBoundsNeverDependOnDirection is the direct proof every other test
// in this round leans on. stretch() computes the two byte positions a walk
// starts and stops at, and this calls it twice — Direction forward, then
// reversed, every other field of the Range held constant — and requires the
// SAME bytes back. Not "the same rows", which a bug shared between the
// fixture and the code under test could hide; the identical []byte, before a
// single key is ever looked up.
//
// This is also where composite bounds (more than one term per end) and a
// mismatch between From.Exclusive and To.Exclusive get their coverage.
// reachShapes (reach_test.go) writes exactly one term per end on purpose —
// its oracle only knows how to check a single-term bound against real rows —
// so the shapes that leaked in rounds two and three are added here directly,
// against stretch(), where no oracle is needed at all.
//
// Task 0045 added a third outcome stretch() can return: refusal, when From
// sorts after To. check() below was written when there were only two
// outcomes — a byte string, always — and used to Fatal the moment either
// call returned an error, which would have made every newly-refused pair in
// the domain crossing below a false failure of THIS test rather than a
// measurement of anything. What "does not depend on Direction" means for a
// function that can now fail is not just "same bytes" any more; it is "same
// bytes, or the same class of refusal" — a bound calculated one way that
// refuses forward and a bound calculated the other way that quietly succeeds
// reversed would be exactly the direction-dependent bug this whole file
// exists to catch, just wearing the new outcome's clothes instead of the
// old one's.
