// or array and writes "&{...}"/"&[...]" only at depth 0 of a single
// fmt.Sprintf call. One level of nesting inside a compound value and it
// falls back to fmtPointer — a bare hex address — instead. renderCapped's
// leaf case calls fmt.Sprintf("%v", leaf) fresh for every leaf, which is
// depth 0 as far as THAT call is concerned regardless of how deep the
// surrounding structure actually is, so a pointer leaf renders as "&{...}"
// there even when the real, single top-level fmt.Sprintf on the whole
// value would have printed a hex address for the exact same leaf.
//
// This never shows on describe's own "fits" path (the common one): when a
// value fits, describe hands the WHOLE value to one real fmt.Sprintf call,
// so a pointer at any depth is formatted exactly the way fmt always
// formats it — there is only one fmt.Sprintf call in that path, at one
// depth, and it is real. The divergence is a property of renderCapped
// alone, so it can only be observed when renderCapped runs on a value that
// would otherwise have fit — which is exactly what task 0049 §8's D7
// (dropping the "fits -> fmt.Sprintf" branch so renderCapped always runs)
// does. Every case in this table below fits comfortably (a slice or map of
