//
// It was not always this way. From and To used to swap which one was the
// upper end depending on Direction — "From is where the walk starts" — and
// three rounds of review each found a different declaration where that swap
// let a caller-chosen direction reach rows no forward call of the same
// declaration could: a constant written at one end only, the two ends
// disagreeing about Exclusive, and the two ends written at different widths.
// All three were the same defect wearing different clothes — a declaration
// whose meaning depended on an argument the person who wrote it never sees —
// so the swap was removed rather than patched a fourth time. See task 0012,
// round 4.

// A From that sorts after To — somebody carrying the old swapped-ends
// convention in their head, or simply a typo — is not read as "the stretch

// it would then have nowhere to spend. See Totals's own doc.

// stretch turns a Range into the two byte positions that bound the walk:

// whole of why it is pulled out of walk into a function of its own — it is
// the one thing that has to be true for "a direction widens nothing" to hold,
// and it has to be provable by calling it twice with Direction flipped and
// comparing the two byte strings, not by reading rows through a fixture.
//
// This round (0045) adds one more thing this is the right place for: a From
// that sorts after To, discovered here because this is where the two bounds
// first exist side by side as bytes. Before this, a caller who wrote the two
// ends backwards — the swapped-ends convention round four retired, or simply
// a mistake — got an empty result indistinguishable from a stretch that is
// legitimately empty. That silence is why task 0045 exists: an operator
// reading "rows: []" off the wire cannot tell "nothing matched" from "this
// declaration can never match anything, with any argument". Refusing it here
// means every caller of stretch() — Scan, walkRange (so Walk and dump too),
// and Totals after task 0043 put it on the same path — inherits the refusal
// for free, which is the point of task 0045 section 1: one calculation, one
// place a caller-shaped mistake in it is caught.
//
// upper != nil guards this on purpose, not defensively: successor() (below)
// returns nil for a prefix of every byte 0xff, meaning "there is no key past
// this, so run to the very end of the keyspace" — the unbounded-above case.
// bytes.Compare treats a nil slice as sorting before everything, so without
// this guard bytes.Compare(lower, nil) > 0 would be true for every non-empty
// lower, and this would refuse every scan with no upper bound at all —
// Walk/dump chief among them. That is not an edge case of this refusal, it
// is most of the traffic it would otherwise break.
//
// lower == upper is not refused, and that is deliberate rather than an
// off-by-one. The shape that produces it is not always what it looks like at
// first: on a string field it is an Exclusive bound pinned against itself
// (see bound() below) — "everything strictly after ann and at or before ann"
// is nothing, and a caller who wrote that meant to pin an empty range. But
// measured directly on a number field, two INCLUSIVE ends one ULP apart —
// From: math.Nextafter(2, +Inf), To: 2, neither Exclusive — land on the
// identical byte string too: keys.Encode's number encoding is dense, so
// successor(encode(2.0)) and encode(Nextafter(2.0)) are the same bytes. So
// the one fact this line relies on is narrower than "a caller pinned an
// empty range on purpose" — it is only ever that a caller-visible pair of
// values (whatever produced the equal byte pair) ended up describing nothing
// between them, which today's density of the number encoding can also do
// with two ordinary inclusive ends. Only lower strictly after upper is
// refused; lower == upper, however it was written, is left to keep reading
// as empty. That is why the comparison below is > and not >=.
//
// Task 0054 measured a narrower counter-example than the number-encoding one
// above, and this paragraph corrects the claim rather than deleting it: on a
// bool field the two things this comment calls different — "an Exclusive
// bound pinned against itself" and "a caller-visible pair describing nothing
// between them" — are not always separable from "a From that sorts after
// To". A bool has exactly two values, so keys.Encode(false)=0x20,
// keys.Encode(true)=0x21, and successor(0x20)=0x21: From=true, To=false
// (INCLUSIVE, backwards by one step) lands on lower==upper, the identical
// bytes an intentionally-empty stretch would produce, and reads as an empty
// answer with no error rather than the ErrArgument a backwards range gets on
// every other field width. Measured on 5a482ea (unmutated) via
// DeclareOperation+Invoke on a one-field bool index: ACCEPTED, 0 rows, nil
// error, both through a constant endpoint and through an argument pair. On a
// number field two values one step apart do NOT collide this way — From=2,
// To=1 encodes to lower≠upper and is refused, same measurement, same commit.
// So on bool, unlike on number, task 0045's promise ("a From that sorts after
// To is refused, never a silent empty stretch") covers none of the domain:
// every backwards pair on a bool field is exactly one step wide. This is not
// fixed here — see TestABackwardsBoolRangeIsAcceptedRatherThanRefused for the
// pinned behavior and the debt this narrows to.
