// A batch is several writes as one transaction.
//
// It is how this store does the things a database is usually asked for an
// interactive transaction to do — an order and its payment and the ledger
// lines that record it, all landing together or not at all. Declared like
// everything else, so its cost is known before it runs and no client holds a
// transaction open while everybody else waits on it.
//
// Two things make that enough without `begin`:
//
//   - Inside a batch nothing else is writing. The engine takes one writer, so
//     a step may read what an earlier step wrote and nobody has changed it in
//     between. The classic hazard — two transactions each checking a balance
//     and both spending it — cannot happen here.
//   - A caller that read something over the network a moment ago says so: a
//     step carries conditions the document must already satisfy. That is the
//     whole of optimistic locking, and it turns "the order was still pending
//     when I looked" into something the store checks rather than hopes.
//
// If any step fails, the transaction is abandoned. Not the step — the
// transaction, because there is one transaction at a time and this is it.
//
// Which is why a batch refuses to start on top of uncommitted work. There are
// no savepoints here and there will not be, so abandoning a failed batch would
// take whatever came before it as well — silently, and only when something
// went wrong, which is the worst moment to discover it. The first test written
// against this tripped over exactly that: it declared three collections, ran a
// batch that was meant to fail, and lost the declarations. A rule that has to
// be remembered is a rule that will be forgotten, so it is checked instead.

// runBatch does every step, or none of them.

// sameValue compares two values the way a condition means it.

// Numbers from JSON are float64 and numbers from a declaration may be written
// as an integer, so comparing them as `any` would make 1 and 1.0 different
// things — which is the sort of difference nobody debugging a refused write
// would think to look for.
//
// That reasoning does not stop at the outer value. condition.Equals is
// declared TypeAny — a condition checks a document field, not an index bound,
// so there is nothing here for a constant to encode into and so nothing to
// refuse at declaration time (see task 0042) — and TypeAny accepts a slice or
// an object exactly as it accepts a string. Either side of the comparison can
// therefore be a []any or a map[string]any, and the 1-vs-1.0 difference can
// sit one level down inside it just as easily as at the top: {"totals":[1]}
// and {"totals":[1.0]} are the same document written two ways. A plain ==
// on such a value does not just get that wrong, it panics outright — two
// interface values whose dynamic type is a slice or a map are exactly what
// Go means by "comparing uncomparable type", and unlike a Term's Value (see
// sameTerm in ops.go) this is an ordinary field pulled out of a stored
// document, not something a schema already limited. So this walks down: an
// array compares element by element, an object compares by key, and only a
// leaf that cannot be either falls back to reflect.DeepEqual — which never
// panics, but which is not asked to do the numeric work, because DeepEqual
// compares dynamic types and would call 1 and 1.0 different again.
//
// The trade this makes, so the next person does not have to rediscover it by
// tripping over it: this recursion keeps no set of pairs it has already
// visited, so a value that (directly or through something it contains) holds
// itself makes it recurse forever instead of returning. JSON cannot build
// one — json.Unmarshal only ever produces a tree — and that is why the left
// side of every call satisfies makes, a document field read back out of this
// store, can never be one: Put marshals a document to JSON before writing
// it, json.Marshal refuses a cycle with its own error instead of hanging, so
// a cyclic document is never stored in the first place. A declared
// condition's constant (door one) is refused the same way, at declare time,
// by DeclareOperation's own Marshal.
//
// Task 0042's QA round asked for the reach of this to be measured rather
// than asserted, and the measured answer is narrower than an earlier draft
// of this comment claimed. A single self-referential operand does not make
// this function loop: the recursion always switches on and descends into
// whichever value it is looking at, and the moment that walk reaches an
// operand that is one of the two JSON-guaranteed trees above, the walk
// bottoms out at that tree's real, finite depth — a length mismatch or a
// failed type assertion ends it, exactly the way it would end an ordinary
// comparison, regardless of what the other operand is doing. So sameValue
// itself can only recurse forever if BOTH operands are self-referential at
// once, which — because a document field never can be — means the only way
// to trigger it is to call this unexported function directly with two
// hand-built cyclic values. Only code inside this package can do that: a
// test.
//
// That is not the same claim as "nothing outside this package can crash the
// process with a cycle," and conflating the two would be the same kind of
// mistake this paragraph is replacing. Door two — {"equals": {"arg": ...}} —
// is declared TypeAny, and bind() (invoke.go) hands a caller's argument to
// resolveIn exactly as given, with no encoding step in between. A caller of
// the exported Invoke, in Go, in the same process, can pass a self-
// referential slice or map as that argument, and nothing here refuses it.
// sameValue survives that call — the paragraph above is why — but satisfies,
// one call above it, does not: every condition that fails to match, which is
// the ordinary outcome an optimistic-locking check exists to produce, formats
// the value into its error with fmt.Errorf("%v", ...), and fmt's printer has
// no cycle protection for a slice or map holding itself through a bare
// interface. It recurses the identical shape sameValue would have and dies
// the identical way. So the door this change (0042) left open was not
// sameValue's own recursion; it was the error message one frame above it,
// reachable by any direct Go caller of Invoke, not only by a test — this
// repo's own front doors do not reach it (cli/shell.go decodes every typed
// word with json.Unmarshal before it ever becomes a Term or an argument, and
// server.go decodes the wire frame the same way), but nothing stops code
// that embeds this store as a library from calling Invoke with a hand-built
// cyclic argument directly.
//
// Either way it happens, it happens the same way: the goroutine's stack
// grows until the runtime gives up, and it gives up with `fatal error: stack
// overflow` — a fatal error, not a panic, which no recover() anywhere can
// catch, including one sitting at a connection's boundary. reflect.DeepEqual
// would close the sameValue half of this (it tracks visited pairs and
// terminates); it would not have touched the satisfies/fmt.Errorf half at
// all, because that crash never reaches sameValue. So 0042's fix traded one
// difference that only shows up through the direct Go API (1 and 1.0
// disagreeing one level down, the reason this function walks at all) for a
// cost of its own making (the recursion above) sitting next to a second cost
// that was already there before that fix touched anything and was not that
// fix's to close: the error path's unguarded %v. Going back to DeepEqual
// would not have bought that second one back — it has its own numeric
// mistake, and it never ran the code that had the %v problem either.
//
// Task 0049 is what closes that second cost: satisfies (below) now formats
// "wanted" and a mismatched "value" through describe (describe.go), which
// walks the exact same []any / map[string]any shapes this function does,
// with a depth and element-count ceiling that makes the walk return an
// answer even when the value holds itself — so a self-referential argument
// through door two now reaches an ordinary ErrCondition, not a second fatal
// stack overflow. describe does not change what sameValue itself can and
// cannot survive (this godoc's account of that, above, is unchanged and the
// tests measuring it — cycle_test.go — still measure exactly that), only
// what the one call site above it that used to crash on the same shape does
// instead. Both costs are still written down here, next to each other,
// because whoever reads this godoc asking "can a cycle reach here" deserves
// the sharper answer, not the one that stops at the function whose name is
// in the question — and because the fix for one was never, on its own, the
// fix for both.
