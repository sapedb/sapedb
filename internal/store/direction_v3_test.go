// This file used to be round three's front door: three shapes — a constant
// at one end only, the two ends disagreeing about Exclusive, and (round
// three's own Reviewer finding, never captured here) the two ends written at
// different widths — were refused because letting the caller pick the
// direction let a call reach rows no forward call of the same declaration
// could, once From and To swapped which one was the walk's upper end.
//
// Round four removed the swap instead of adding a fourth rule for a fourth
// shape. So every test that used to assert ErrDeclaration for one of these
// shapes now asserts the opposite: the shape declares, and forward and
// reverse read one stretch, backwards on the second call. Nothing here
// measures a refusal any more — reach_test.go's
// TestEveryShapeOfDeclarationDeclaresAndReadsOneStretchBothWays and
// direction_v4_test.go's TestTheTwoBoundsNeverDependOnDirection already cover
// the general case; what stays here is the concrete, front-door version of
// exactly the shapes three rounds of review argued about, so a reader who
// followed those rounds can see where each one landed.

// TestAnExclusiveEndAloneDeclaresAndReadsOneStretchBothWays is QA's original
// leak from round three, declared through the real front door. It used to be
// refused: a row at the floor of by_slug (id "", slug "") never came back on
// a forward call and came back on a single reverse one, because Exclusive
// was checked against From and To as if they were fixed roles rather than
// the low and high end reversing swapped. Neither end is fixed to a role by
// Direction any more, so there is nothing left to leak and nothing left to
// refuse: forward and reverse over the same From/To now read the same
// stretch, in opposite order.

// TestByAuthorMissingPublishedReadsOneStretchBothWaysExclusiveIncluded is
// round three's section 1 test #2, re-measured: the leak was never a trick of
// the empty string. by_author is (author ascending, published number,
// Descending, MissingLast). Descending flips the byte order of published and
// MissingLast then sorts a document with no published date after that
// flipped order — so within one author's group, the row missing the field
// sits at the very floor, byte for byte the same shape as "" at the floor of
// by_slug.
//
// Round three refused this shape outright because forward could never reach
// the floor row past an exclusive bound while reverse always could, once the
// two ends swapped roles. With nothing swapping, an exclusive bound at
// From — the low end, in both directions — excludes the floor row from BOTH
// calls, which is what "a direction widens nothing" was supposed to mean in
