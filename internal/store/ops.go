// Declared operations are the only way into a database.
//
// There is no query on the wire. A caller names an operation that is already
// stored here and passes arguments to it, and the operation says exactly which
// collection it touches, which index it walks, how far, what it returns and
// who may run it. Everything a query would decide at runtime is decided when
// the operation is declared, which has two consequences worth the whole
// design:
//
//   - Injection has nowhere to happen. An argument is a value in a bound or a
//     field of a document; it can never become part of the access path,
//     because the access path was fixed before the argument existed.
//   - The cost is known before anything runs. A scan without a declared limit
//     is a scan whose cost nobody has worked out, so declaring one is refused
//     rather than defaulted — a default there is a promise made on behalf of
//     whoever has to serve it.
//
// Operations are versioned and old versions are kept. Changing one writes a
// new version rather than replacing the old, so an audit record that says
// which operation ran can still be read back years later.

	// Key is which document, for the actions that work on exactly one.
	Key *Term `json:"key,omitempty"`

	// Rollup is which declared total to read, for an operation that reads one.
	Rollup string `json:"rollup,omitempty"`

	// Index, From and To are the access path of a scan: which index, and where
	// along it to start and stop. Nothing else may narrow a scan, so nothing
	// else can be smuggled into one.
	Index string    `json:"index,omitempty"`
	From  *Endpoint `json:"from,omitempty"`
	To    *Endpoint `json:"to,omitempty"`

	// Direction is which way along that index the scan runs: "forward", the
	// index's own order, or "reverse", that order read back to front. Absent
	// is forward.
	//
	// It is a Term rather than a plain string so that one mechanism covers
	// both ways of deciding it — a constant term fixes the direction in the
	// declaration, an argument term lets the caller choose per call — and both
	// are already the vocabulary everything else here is written in.
	//
	// From is the low end of the stretch and To is the high end, in BOTH
	// directions — Direction changes only the order rows come back in, never
	// which rows they are. One declaration read both ways is therefore one
	// stretch, read from either end: a caller that flips the direction and
	// leaves From and To alone gets the same rows back, backwards.
	//
	// This is a change from an older convention some callers may still carry
	// in their head, where a reversed read meant writing From as the high
	// value and To as the low one. Doing that today is refused, in EITHER
	// direction, because From is unconditionally the low end regardless of
	// what value is written there: a From that sorts after To is not a
	// stretch that happens to be empty, it is a declaration that could never
	// return a row with any argument, and task 0045 changed this from a
	// silent empty answer — indistinguishable on the wire from a stretch that
	// is legitimately empty — into an error instead. It is caught as early as
	// the shape allows: at DeclareOperation, if both ends are constants
	// (ErrDeclaration, validateOperation below); at Invoke, if either end is
	// an argument or a step's key (ErrArgument, stretch() in scan.go), since
	// only then does a value for it exist to compare. Pinning both ends to
	// the same point, with Exclusive making one of them not quite equal to
	// the other, is a different shape — a caller-intended empty range — and
	// that one still runs; see stretch()'s own doc for exactly where the line
	// between the two is.
	//
	// It is still the one thing about a scan an argument may decide, and it is
	// safe for a reason that does not generalise to anything else: it widens
	// nothing. The index is the declared one, the limit is the declared one,
	// From and To are the declared ones — Direction is read nowhere while the
	// two bounds are being worked out, so there is no declaration shaped in a
	// way that lets a caller-chosen direction reach a row a forward call of
	// the same declaration could not. Earlier rounds tried to get there by
	// refusing every shape where that could go wrong instead — a constant at
	// one end only, the two ends disagreeing about Exclusive, the two ends
	// written at different widths — and each round's rule caught the leak it
	// was aimed at and missed the next one. There is no such rule now, because
	// there is nothing left for one to catch.
	//
	// Limit is the one place a caller-chosen direction still matters, and it is
	// meant to: with a limit smaller than the stretch, the two directions hand
	// back the two different ends of it — the ten most recent rows and the ten
	// oldest are different sets on purpose. That is what this feature exists to
	// do, not a widening of the declaration.
	//
	// "Reverse" reverses the order the index declared, as a whole. An index on
	// (a ascending, b descending) read in reverse gives (a descending, b
	// ascending), not (a descending, b descending) — that last one is a third
	// order and still needs an index of its own. The word is deliberately not
	// "descending", which is what a single field is.

// crosses partitions is the results of several indexes one after another.
// Whether that is the right order depends on the collection, and it is
// knowable here, which is the only place it should ever be decided.
//
// Time: partition names sort in the order the periods happened, and the key is
// a ulid, so partition order is key order. Every index entry ends with the key.
// So the concatenation is correctly ordered as long as the declared fields of
// the index are all fixed and the only thing varying is the key. A scan that
// leaves a declared field free would return, say, every account of January
// before every account of February.
//
// Hash: partition order is hash order, which is no order at all. Nothing that
// crosses partitions can be ordered, so nothing may.

// A direction changes none of this. Reversing a sequence that is in key order
// leaves it in key order — that part holds unconditionally, and it is why a
// scan that may not run forward may not run backward either, and why there is
// nothing extra to refuse here and nothing extra to allow.
