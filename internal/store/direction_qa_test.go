// TestABoundThatFallsAwayUndoesWhatScanAcrossPromised records the one case
// where the promise the reversed walk leans on is not kept.
//
// The argument for reversing the partition list is that scanAcross has already
// guaranteed the partitions concatenated in partition order are in key order,
// so the reverse of that is in reverse key order. scanAcross makes that
// guarantee by insisting a scan on a secondary index fixes every declared
// field and lets only the key vary — but it checks the TERMS, at declaration
// time, and a term may be an optional argument. bounds() drops an endpoint
// whose argument was not given, on purpose: "an operation that takes an
// optional since is unbounded below when nobody passes one."
//
// Put those two together and the fixed field is not fixed at call time. The
// scan then runs the whole index of January, then the whole index of February,
// which is account order inside a partition and partition order across them —
// the exact shape scanAcross exists to refuse.
//
// This asserts what the code does today rather than what it should do, because
// it is not a regression: the forward walk has the same hole and had it before
// direction existed. It is pinned here so that whoever closes it — by making a
// bound term that decides a partitioned scan required, most likely — sees this
// test go red and knows to delete it.
