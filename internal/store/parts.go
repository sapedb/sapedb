// One database, several files, one commit.
//
// A partition earns its keep by being droppable: unlinking a file returns a
// month of data to the operating system, where deleting the same documents
// through a copy-on-write tree would rewrite most of it and leave a free list
// that only grows. That is the whole reason this exists, and everything here
// is in service of it staying true.
//
// Where each partition is — its tree root, its free list, its length — is kept
// in the leader's own tree, under a prefix of its own. Nothing about the file
// format changes, because the leader's tree root already is the commit point:
// recording a partition's position is an ordinary write, and it becomes true
// at exactly the moment every other write of that transaction does.
//
// The order is what makes it safe, and it is the only order that works:
//
//  1. Each partition writes its pages and syncs. Nothing about the database
//     has changed yet — those pages are not reachable from anything.
//  2. The leader records where each partition now is, in its tree.
//  3. The leader commits: data, sync, meta, sync.
//
// A crash anywhere before the end of 3 leaves partitions holding pages nobody
// points at, and a leader that never heard of them. That is the same state a
// single file has had all along mid-transaction, and it has the same answer:
// the next transaction allocates over them.

// spaceParts is where the leader keeps the position of each partition.

// partRecord is the fixed size of what is kept: three page numbers.
