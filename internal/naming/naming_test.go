// TestWalkScansFilesWithNoRecognisedExtensionOrADotPrefix closes three gaps

// test above unchanged. That is exactly the filter that would have missed
// this rename's own real work: this tree has seven non-.go files —
// Dockerfile, Makefile, docker-compose.yml, README.md,
// examples/ledger/run.mjs, .gitignore, .dockerignore — and it is precisely
// those files where the task changed the image tag, ENTRYPOINT,
// /var/lib/sapedb, and the volume name. Along the way, a second axis:
// nothing above plants a hit in a dotfile either, so a mutant that skipped
// any file whose name starts with "." would also pass unchanged, and would
// have missed .gitignore and .dockerignore for a second, unrelated reason.
//
// Round 4 added the third axis, still the same underlying cause read one
// level up: the fixtures above close the dot-prefixed *file* case, but
// nothing here planted a hit inside a dot-prefixed *directory*, and
// .github/workflows/*.yml is exactly the file this rename's own image tag
// (built from target, the same one Dockerfile's fixture below uses) would
// have kept living in unnoticed if a mutant taught Walk to SkipDir on any
// directory name starting with ".". skipDirs today only
// skips .git, node_modules, and dist by exact name, so that mutant is not
// live against the real source — but nothing before round 4 proved it
// wasn't, and the exact same fixture shape (a dot-prefixed file, this time
