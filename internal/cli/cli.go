// Package cli is the tool that sets a database up and looks inside it.
//
// It exists because declaring is not an operation. Everything a client can do
// over the wire is an operation the database already holds, which means a new
// database can do nothing at all until somebody puts the first declarations in
// it — and that somebody is on the same host as the file, not on the far end
// of a connection.
//
// Every command here opens the database file directly, and the file takes an
// exclusive lock. So a command run while the server is up is refused rather
// than quietly becoming the second writer: see internal/vfs for what two
// writers do to one of these files.
