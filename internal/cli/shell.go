// The shell an operator types at.
//
// What somebody can type here is a list of keywords in fixed positions. That
// is not a simplification of something richer that comes later — it is the
// whole design. A shell with an expression language is a second interface into
// the database, more powerful than the one the application uses and reachable
// by anyone who reaches the port, and the industry's own answer to having
// built one is a configuration flag that turns it off in production.
//
// So: a document by its key, a stretch of a declared index, a count of one,
// and a list of what is here. Values are written as JSON, because that is the
// one notation where "12" and 12 are visibly different things, which matters
// when a key might be either.
//
// Every session ends the same way: `declare` prints the operation that would
// do what you just did. Exploring that leaves nothing behind becomes a habit
// of exploring; exploring that ends in a declaration becomes a schema.

  invoke <name> [arg=value]...       run a declared operation
  get <collection> <key>             one document by its key
  scan <collection> [index] [...]    a stretch of an index
  count <collection> [index] [...]   how many are in that stretch
  declare [name]                     the operation that would do the last thing
  help                               this
  exit                               leave

  A scan or a count takes, in any order:
    from <value>...       where to start   (after <value>... to exclude it)
    to <value>...         where to stop    (before <value>... to exclude it)
    limit <n>             how many rows at most
    fields <a> <b>...     which fields to show

  Values are JSON: "a string", 42, true, null.
