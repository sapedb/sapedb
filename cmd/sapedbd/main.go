// Command sapedbd serves databases over the sapedb protocol.
//
// Everything it needs comes from the environment, so the same image runs in a
// container, under systemd, or on a laptop without a different invocation:
//
//	SAPEDB_SECRET     what connection strings are signed with (required)
//	SAPEDB_ADDR       where to listen                       (default :7433)
//	SAPEDB_DIR        where databases live                  (default /var/lib/sapedb)
//	SAPEDB_TLS_CERT   certificate, with SAPEDB_TLS_KEY
//	SAPEDB_TLS_KEY    its key
//	SAPEDB_INSECURE   1 to serve without TLS, said out loud
//	SAPEDB_ENCRYPT    1 to encrypt every database at rest
//	SAPEDB_LABEL      signing label, if not the default
//	SAPEDB_SHUTDOWN   how long to let connections finish    (default 20s)
//
//	SAPEDB_FOLLOW            a connection string to keep a copy of
//	SAPEDB_FOLLOW_INSECURE   1 to dial that leader without TLS
//
// SAPEDB_FOLLOW makes this daemon a follower: it subscribes to that database's
// change log from wherever its own copy has got to, applies what arrives, and
// refuses every write of its own — including reading the catalogue and the
// operator shell, both of which record an entry. See internal/follow.
//
// There is no logic here on purpose. What this command decides is decided in
// internal/service, where it can be tested without starting a process.
